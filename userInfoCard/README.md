# User Info Card

This is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that creates an information card that displays a user's first name, last name, country, phone number, state, city, and village.

The HTML code creates the basic structure of the information card. The CSS code styles the card. The JavaScript code populates the card with the user's information.

The HTML code contains an <div> element with the ID of infoCard. This element contains all of the other elements on the card.

The CSS code styles the info-card element with a width of 300px, a height of 200px, and a background color of  #0eecb4. The CSS code also styles the text on the card with a font size of 16px and a color of #f58b4e.

The JavaScript code gets the user's information from the fields in the HTML code. The JavaScript code then populates the card with the user's information.
