# Digital Clock:
We will create a user-friendly digital clock that displays the current time on a website with a beautiful design, title, and background image. We'll get the current time from the computer and display it in a digital format using JavaScript. The clock will always show the accurate time, synchronized with the computer's time.

First, we create an HTML file for the basic structure h2 tag used for the heading After that one main div contains all the content after that we use the span tag for hours minutes seconds am all of the inside these span tags. And now we apply styling the make beautiful designs.
Now we are working on the js file  first to access all hours, minutes, seconds, and amPM with the help of document.querySelector().
after that, we created a function updateTime() and wrote the concept for our digital clock.
