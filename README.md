We create a textbox and an "Add" button and then append the entered text to <p> tags one below another.
In this task, the addEventListener method is used to listen for the "click" event on the "Add" button. When the button is clicked, the entered text is retrieved from the text input (textInput), and if the text is not empty, a new <p> element is created using the document.createElement("p"), the text content is set, and it's appended to the outputContainer div using the appendChild method.
